I am a final-year undergraduate student at Fudan University, majoring in Intelligence Science and Engineering. I am currently working as a research intern at System Research Group of Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).

Previously, I was a research intern at Nanyang Technological University, where I worked with Prof. Siqiang Luo on self-adaptive LSM-Tree based storage system. I have also worked with Prof. Yang Yu from IIIS, Tsinghua University on causal intervention for the robustness of NLP models. During the summer of 2022, I visited RISE Lab at UC Berkeley and worked with Dr. Dixin Tang and Prof. Aditya Parameswaran on efficent dependency management in spreadsheets.
