I am currently a first-year CS PhD student at UW-Madison, working with [Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in 2023.

During my undergraduate studies, I have worked at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/systems-and-networking/), [UC Berkeley](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/), and [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse). I had industry internships at Moonshot AI and Wish.

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and data-intensive systems.
