Hi! I am Fanchao Chen, a CS PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working with [Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/). I obtained my bachelor degree from Fudan University, Shanghai in 2023.

My research interests include machine learning systems, foundation models, and data-intensive systems.
